        This specification defines an API allowing <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest">web applications</a> to set an application-wide badge,
        shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the
        application (such as the shelf or home screen), for the purpose of
        notifying the user when the state of the application has changed (e.g.,
        when new messages have arrived), without showing a more heavyweight
        <a data-cite="NOTIFICATIONS">notification</a>.

        This specification is currently a work in progress. Implementors should
        not expose the API surface to the open web.

        Usage examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following example shows how an email application might set a badge
        showing the unread count, which is updated whenever the client polls
        for mail from the server.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Showing unread count">
        async function pollForMail() {
          // ... Fetch unread mail from server. ...

          // Set the app icon badge. If getUnreadCount() returns 0, this is
          // equivalent to Badge.clear().
          Badge.set(getUnreadCount());
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The next example shows how a game might show when it is the player's
        turn.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Showing ready status">
        function showPlayerTurn(playerTurnId) {
          if (playerTurnId == localPlayerId)
            Badge.set();
          else
            Badge.clear();
        }

      <h2>
        Badge model
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is a single global badge associated with each <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest">web application</a>. At any time, the application's badge
        is set to one of the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The special value <b>nothing</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The special value <b>flag</b>.
        </li>
        <li>An <code><a data-cite="WEBIDL#idl-unsigned-long-long">unsigned long
        long</a></code> value, which MUST NOT be 0.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The user agent MUST initialize each application's badge to
        <b>nothing</b>. The user agent MAY reset an application's badge to
        <b>nothing</b> at its discretion (for example, when the system is
        restarted).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the application's badge is <b>nothing</b>, the badge is said to be
        "<dfn>cleared</dfn>". Otherwise, it is said to be "<dfn>set</dfn>".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Badge display
      </h2>
      <p>
        When the application is <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest#dfn-installing">installed</a> and the application's flag
        is <a>set</a>, the user agent SHOULD display the application's badge
        alongside the symbolic representation of the application in the user's
        operating system (for example, as a small overlay on top of the
        application's icon).
      </p>
      <p>
        The special value <b>flag</b> indicates that the badge is set, but
        contains no specific data. In this case, the user agent SHOULD show an
        indicator with a non-specific symbol (such as a coloured circle).
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY simplify or degrade the data in any way. For
        example, a large integer may be saturated (for example, as "99+"). The
        font and formatting are entirely at the user agent's discretion. The
        user agent MAY ignore the data, and merely show a marker when the
        status is <a>set</a>.

        This section is not clear about which web application is associated

          It is a bit weird that <code>set(0)</code> clears the badge, while
          <code>set()</code> sets it to <b>flag</b>. This is designed so that
          the above example code for setting the unread count will
          automatically clear the badge when the unread count is 0. But it
          could be a bit unintuitive.
